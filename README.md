## Project Name: 'JUMPGUY'

## Game Description:

### Main action:

The main action in my game is jumping, which I implemented with a simple button input and tweaks of the player physics and gravity. The main action of jumping is an integral part of my project's core gameplay loop which consists of jumping between platforms - avoiding the water, towards the end of the level. Less important or optional actions include collecting collectables or confronting enemies using the punching mechanic.

### Hardest part of development:

I personally found creating a C++ based actor (my potion collectables) the most difficult part of developing my project. What made it difficult was learning how to properly setup the scene root component so that translations could be appropriately applied to my static mesh. Another large challenge (and timesink) was animations, getting these fidly things working - and looking, just right was very difficult. Although I am now confident setting up character animations, state machines, and blendspaces.

### Most interesting part of the game:

The most interesting part of my game in my opinion is the level design and environments, I tried to create levels which presented the player with clear direction as well as an element of choice. I also did my best to make the environments the player is progressing through feel natural and alive, to make the experience feel more immersive.

I hope to have given the player at least a small amount of possible exploration, presenting the player with the option of going out of their way to find extra collectables in each level.
